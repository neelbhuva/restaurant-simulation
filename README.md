Resources - Cook, tables, machines for cooking

The simulation has four sets of parameters - the number of eaters (diners) that wish to enter the restaurant, the times they
approach the restaurant and what they order, the number of tables in the restaurant (there can only be as many eaters as there 
are tables at a time; other eaters must wait for a free table before placing their order), and the number of cooks in the
kitchen that process orders.

Tables and machines for cooking the food are resources whose use must be coordinated among the threads.
